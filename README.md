## Pre-Prints

A similar search undertaken on Med/Bio-Rxiv resulted in two related papers.

**Patel et al** (2020) - Impact of COVID on MH remote prescribing & psychiatry consulting.
Found remote consultations increased as in person clinics reduced BUT prescriptions of anti-psychotics and mood stabilisers remained consistent with pre-pandemic trends. Based at South London & Maudsley in London, UK.
Used Natural Language Processing service (CRIS) to access patient records/letters.

**Torabi et al** (2021) - Effect of COVID on dispensing patterns.
Found increased number of items dispensed in 2020 vs. 2016-2019, with peaks in March & June 2020 and reduction in between. CNS prescriptions (includes Anxiolytics, Hypnotics & SSRIs) follow same pattern.
National Cohort (Wales) prescribing data.
